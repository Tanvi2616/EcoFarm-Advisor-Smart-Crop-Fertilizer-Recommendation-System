## 🌿 EcoFarm Advisor: Crop & Fertilizer Recommendation System

EcoFarm Advisor is an AI-powered farming assistant that recommends the best suitable crop, fertilizers, organic alternatives, and provides live weather insights based on soil nutrients and location. It uses a trained Machine Learning model along with real-time weather data to support sustainable and smart agriculture. The project includes a modern UI built with Streamlit.

## 🚀 Features
- Recommends the most suitable crop based on soil N, P, K, and pH
- Fetches live weather data (temperature, humidity, rainfall) using OpenWeather API
- Provides a soil health report for N, P, K, and pH
- Suggests chemical fertilizers + organic alternative fertilizers
- Displays soil moisture estimation
- Calculates carbon emissions (CO₂e) based on fertilizer usage
- Clean, interactive UI built with Streamlit
