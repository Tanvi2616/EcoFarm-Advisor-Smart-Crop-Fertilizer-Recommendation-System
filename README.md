# 🌿 EcoFarm Advisor – Crop Recommendation System

A Machine Learning–based web app that recommends the best crop and fertilizers using soil nutrients (N, P, K), pH, and live weather data.  
Built with Python, Streamlit, and a Decision Tree model (94.8% accuracy), the system also provides soil health analysis, organic fertilizer alternatives, and carbon emission (CO₂e) estimation to support sustainable farming.


## 📥 Inputs
N, P, K, pH, soil type, city/district.

## 📤 Outputs
Crop recommendation, fertilizers, organic alternatives, weather report, soil moisture, and CO₂e emissions.

## 🔮 Future Scope
IoT sensors, yield prediction, disease detection, mobile app.
